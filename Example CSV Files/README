In this directory are example BOMs for each of our Year 9 Rev A boards:  
	Battery Buzzer
	Load Cell
	PDB
	RFID
	Servo Controller
	Team Flag
	Twistit
	Yogi Bear

Each corresponding BOM is named <Board Name>.csv.

In addition, there are two other CSV files, Board Quantity.csv and Example Aggregation Output.csv.

Board Quantity.csv provides the quantities of each board ordered.

Example Aggregation Output.csv is provided as a reference for what the output of your aggregation script may possibly look like.  I encourage you to experiment with alternative output formats if you are so inclined--but if not, following this format is perfectly acceptable.
